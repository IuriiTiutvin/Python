>>>>>>POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FOR SPOTIFY:

NEED TO INCLUDE SOLO SINGERS

________________________
might give a different artist for a search(Romeo), we have to check that an artist does kpop
________________________




text recognition may not understand Korean

some artists may not show up in spotify search(would instead click on an album, and mess up the whole program)(ex. Super Junior-H, Romeo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
need to have a system where first checks that the artist is found!!!

if a group has less than 3 playlists, discography will be in a different place

should probably first show all songs that will remove, then remove them:
in case the way we serched for songs to remove includes a good song.


>>>>>>>ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:

should probably have a detailed log, to A) make sure every song gets added, and then remain after removal of copies, B) if breaks, we know what broke, C) we know if an artist is not detected or if a song is not added


use UI to navigate:
problem:  we dont know # of albums or songs
solution: can detect green play button
